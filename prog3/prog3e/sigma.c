//  Using OpenMP, write a program which accepts integer start, stop, and step values 
//  (in that order) as command-line arguments and calculates in parallel both the sum and 
//  product from start to stop (inclusive) in increments of step. Be sure to use the 
//  proper reductions, and check to be sure that the results are correct. Call this sigma.c.
